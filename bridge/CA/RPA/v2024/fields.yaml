    summary: Who pays the city transfer tax, if applicable.
    detail: >-
      Who pays the city transfer tax, if applicable. Not all California cities impose a transfer tax — but those that do
      can have significantly higher rates. For example, Los Angeles charges $4.50 per $1,000, Oakland charges $15.00 per
      $1,000, and San Francisco charges a graduated rate. Check whether the property's city has a transfer tax and the
      applicable rate.
